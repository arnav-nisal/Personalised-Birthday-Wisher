# Personalized Birthday Wisher (Web Archive)

This repository contains the source code for a small, personal website I built (circa 2020-2021). The project's simple, fun goal was to wish friends and family a happy birthday with a unique and personal touch, moving beyond just a static "Happy Birthday" text or image.

## Repository Status

**Please Note:** This is a public archive and is **not actively maintained**. The code is preserved here for historical and personal reference and **does not reflect my current skill level.**

This was an early web development project. The code is provided as-is.

## Project Concept: The "Personal Touch"

The core idea was to create a unique, customized greeting for each person.

### How It Works

Instead of a generic page, this website was manually updated for each friend's or family member's birthday.

1.  **Code Customization:** Before a person's birthday, I would directly edit the HTML and/or JavaScript files.
2.  **Personal Details:** I would hard-code the person's name and add any other custom messages or personal touches directly into the source code.
3.  **Deploy:** I would then commit and push these changes to make the personalized site live for their birthday.
4.  **Revert:** After their birthday, I would revert the changes or prepare the site for the next person.

This manual process allowed for complete creative control and a truly personal greeting for each individual.

### Technologies Used

This project is a simple, front-end-only site built with:

* **HTML5:** For the page structure and personalized content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and visual elements (e.g., animations, colors, layout).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For any dynamic effects or animations on the page.
